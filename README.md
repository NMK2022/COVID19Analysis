# COVID19Analysis

## Introduction

This project was created as a response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Utilizing mortality data from ourworldindata.org 
and population data from population.un.org I analyzed the worldwide mortality and testing rates of Covid-19. This data
was then presented visually in a line graph.

### Status
This project is ongoing and will be updated as the Covid-19 pandemic continues. It currently only holds data from the middle
of March until the end of April. New data is compiled daily since I first completed it and will be updated in the future to 
reflect this additional data. Further, this project has the potential to be expanded based on data analyzed.
